# Authentication System

This project provides a multi-modal authentication system using face, hand, voice, and body recognition technologies. The system captures and processes data from various sensors and calculates a weighted label to authenticate users.

## Features

- **Face Recognition**: Uses a pre-trained model to recognize faces.
- **Hand Recognition**: Identifies hand gestures or patterns.
- **Voice Recognition**: Processes audio input for voice authentication.
- **Body Recognition**: Analyzes body movements for additional authentication (placeholder for future implementation).
